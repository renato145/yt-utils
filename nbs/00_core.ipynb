       "'This free course is designed for people with some coding experience who want to learn how to apply deep learning and machine learning to practical problems.\\n\\nThis course covers topics such as how to:\\n- Build and train deep learning models for computer vision, natural language processing, tabular analysis, and collaborative filtering problems\\n- Create random forests and regression models\\n- Deploy models\\n- Use PyTorch, the world’s fastest growing deep learning software, plus popular libraries like fastai and Hugging Face\\n\\nThere are 9 lessons, and each lesson is around 90 minutes long. The course is based on our 5-star rated book, which is freely available online.\\n\\nYou don’t need any special hardware or software — we’ll show you how to use free resources for both building and deploying models. You don’t need any university math either — we’ll teach you the calculus and linear algebra you need during the course.'"
